## Code snippets

**Here** I just test stuff

```{r}
paste("Hello", "World!")
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
